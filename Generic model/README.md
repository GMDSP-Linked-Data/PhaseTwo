Status: testing 

This is a first attempt to create a generic Refine project, that could be applied to any dataset focussed on a Thing at a Place, for example:

- Streetlights 
- Illuminated Bollards
- Bus Shelters
- etc

This work utilise the ISA Programme Location Core Vocabulary (locn) to describe the location/address/geometry) of the Thing.

http://www.w3.org/ns/locn.html

An example gmdsp:Thing resource is used - which should be edited accordingly.

The package consists of:

- Example spreadsheet
- Example Open Refine project 
- JSON file for the RDF Skeleton (which can be applied to other datasets)
- Example output RDF file
